.SH NAME
chocolate\-strife \- historically compatible strife engine
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B chocolate\-strife
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Chocolate Strife is an accurate and complete recreation of Rogue
Entertainment's "Strife: Quest for the Sigil". It was created through
more than two years of reverse engineering effort with the blessings
of the original programmers of the game (see the section HISTORY below).

.SH IWAD SEARCH PATHS
To play, an IWAD file is needed. This is a large file containing all of the
levels, graphics, sound effects, music and other material that make up the
game. IWAD files are named according to the game; the standard names are:
.TP
\fBdoom.wad, doom1.wad, doom2.wad, tnt.wad, plutonia.wad\fR
Doom, Doom II, Final Doom
.TP
\fBheretic.wad, heretic1.wad, hexen.wad, strife1.wad\fR
Heretic, Hexen and Strife (commercial Doom engine games).
.TP
\fBhacx.wad, chex.wad\fR
Hacx and Chex Quest - more obscure games based on the Doom engine.
.TP
\fBfreedm.wad, freedoom1.wad, freedoom2.wad\fR
The Freedoom open content IWAD files.
.LP
The following directory paths are searched in order to find an IWAD:
.TP
\fBCurrent working directory\fR
Any IWAD files found in the current working directory will be used in
preference to IWADs found in any other directories.
.TP
\fBDOOMWADDIR\fR
This environment variable can be set to contain a path to a single directory
in which to look for IWAD files. This environment variable is supported by
most Doom source ports.
.TP
\fBDOOMWADPATH\fR
This environment variable, if set, can contain a colon-separated list of
directories in which to look for IWAD files, or alternatively full paths to
specific IWAD files.
.TP
\fB$HOME/.local/share/games/doom\fR
Writeable directory in the user's home directory. The path can be overridden
using the \fBXDG_DATA_HOME\fR environment variable (see the XDG Base Directory
Specification).
.TP
\fB/usr/local/share/games/doom, /usr/share/games/doom\fR
System-wide locations that can be accessed by all users. The path
\fB/usr/share/games/doom\fR is a standard path that is supported by most
Doom source ports. These paths can be overridden using the \fBXDG_DATA_DIRS\fR
environment variable (see the XDG Base Directory Specification).
.LP
The above can be overridden on a one-time basis by using the \fB\-iwad\fR
command line parameter to provide the path to an IWAD file to use. This
parameter can also be used to specify the name of a particular IWAD to use
from one of the above paths. For example, '\fB-iwad doom.wad\fR' will search
the above paths for the file \fBdoom.wad\fR to use.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
This section describes environment variables that control Chocolate Strife's
behavior.
.TP
\fBDOOMWADDIR\fR, \fBDOOMWADPATH\fR
See the section, \fBIWAD SEARCH PATHS\fR above.
.TP
\fBPCSOUND_DRIVER\fR
When running in PC speaker sound effect mode, this environment variable
specifies a PC speaker driver to use for sound effect playback.  Valid
options are "Linux" for the Linux console mode driver, "BSD" for the
NetBSD/OpenBSD PC speaker driver, and "SDL" for SDL-based emulated PC speaker
playback (using the digital output).
.TP
\fBOPL_DRIVER\fR
When using OPL MIDI playback, this environment variable specifies an
OPL backend driver to use.  Valid options are "SDL" for an SDL-based
software emulated OPL chip, "Linux" for the Linux hardware OPL driver,
and "OpenBSD" for the OpenBSD/NetBSD hardware OPL driver.

Generally speaking, a real hardware OPL chip sounds better than software
emulation; however, modern machines do not often include one. If
present, it may still require extra work to set up and elevated
security privileges to access.


.SH FILES
.TP
\fB$HOME/.local/share/chocolate-doom/strife.cfg\fR
The main configuration file for Chocolate Strife.  See \fBstrife.cfg\fR(5).
.TP
\fB$HOME/.local/share/chocolate-doom/chocolate-strife.cfg\fR
Extra configuration values that are specific to Chocolate Strife and not
present in Vanilla Strife.  See \fBchocolate-strife.cfg\fR(5).

.SH HISTORY
The source code for Strife was lost, which means, unlike the code for all the
other commercial DOOM-engine games, it cannot be released. The only access we
have to the code is the binary executable file. Reverse engineering tools
were employed to disassemble and decompile the executables, which were cross-
referenced against the Linux DOOM and DOS Heretic sources and painstakingly
combed over multiple times, instruction-by-instruction, to ensure that the
resulting Chocolate-Doom-based executable is as close as possible to the
original.

.SH LEGALITY
Reverse engineering is a protected activity so long as the original code is
not used directly in the product. Due to the vast amount of information lost
through the process of compilation, and the need to refactor large portions
of code in order to eliminate non-portable idioms or to adapt them properly to
Chocolate Doom's framework, the resulting code behaves the same, but is not
the *same* code.

In addition, James Monroe and John Carmack have both stated that they have no
objections to the project. Because they are the original authors of the code,
and neither Rogue nor their publisher, Velocity, Inc., exist any longer as
legal entities, this is effectively legal permission.

.SH BUGS
Chocolate Strife is almost, but not entirely perfect, in recreating the
behavior of Vanilla Strife.  Help us by reporting any discrepancies you
might notice between this executable and the vanilla DOS program.

However, do *not* report any glitch that you can replicate in the vanilla EXE
as a bug. The point of Chocolate Strife, like Chocolate Doom before it, is to
be as bug-compatible with the original game as possible. Also be aware that
some glitches are impossible to compatibly recreate, and wherever this is the
case, Chocolate Strife has erred on the side of not crashing the program,
for example by initializing pointers to NULL rather than using them without
setting a value first.

.SH AUTHORS
Chocolate Strife is part of the Chocolate Doom project. It was reverse
engineered from the DOS versions of Strife by James Haley and Samuel
Villarreal.
Chocolate Doom was written and maintained by Simon Howard, and is based
on the LinuxDoom source code released by Id Software.
