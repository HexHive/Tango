.SH IWAD SEARCH PATHS
To play, an IWAD file is needed. This is a large file containing all of the
levels, graphics, sound effects, music and other material that make up the
game. IWAD files are named according to the game; the standard names are:
.TP
\fBdoom.wad, doom1.wad, doom2.wad, tnt.wad, plutonia.wad\fR
Doom, Doom II, Final Doom
.TP
\fBheretic.wad, heretic1.wad, hexen.wad, strife1.wad\fR
Heretic, Hexen and Strife (commercial Doom engine games).
.TP
\fBhacx.wad, chex.wad\fR
Hacx and Chex Quest - more obscure games based on the Doom engine.
.TP
\fBfreedm.wad, freedoom1.wad, freedoom2.wad\fR
The Freedoom open content IWAD files.
.LP
The following directory paths are searched in order to find an IWAD:
.TP
\fBCurrent working directory\fR
Any IWAD files found in the current working directory will be used in
preference to IWADs found in any other directories.
.TP
\fBDOOMWADDIR\fR
This environment variable can be set to contain a path to a single directory
in which to look for IWAD files. This environment variable is supported by
most Doom source ports.
.TP
\fBDOOMWADPATH\fR
This environment variable, if set, can contain a colon-separated list of
directories in which to look for IWAD files, or alternatively full paths to
specific IWAD files.
.TP
\fB$HOME/.local/share/games/doom\fR
Writeable directory in the user's home directory. The path can be overridden
using the \fBXDG_DATA_HOME\fR environment variable (see the XDG Base Directory
Specification).
.TP
\fB/usr/local/share/games/doom, /usr/share/games/doom\fR
System-wide locations that can be accessed by all users. The path
\fB/usr/share/games/doom\fR is a standard path that is supported by most
Doom source ports. These paths can be overridden using the \fBXDG_DATA_DIRS\fR
environment variable (see the XDG Base Directory Specification).
.LP
The above can be overridden on a one-time basis by using the \fB\-iwad\fR
command line parameter to provide the path to an IWAD file to use. This
parameter can also be used to specify the name of a particular IWAD to use
from one of the above paths. For example, '\fB-iwad doom.wad\fR' will search
the above paths for the file \fBdoom.wad\fR to use.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
This section describes environment variables that control Chocolate Hexen's
behavior.
.TP
\fBDOOMWADDIR\fR, \fBDOOMWADPATH\fR
See the section, \fBIWAD SEARCH PATHS\fR above.
.TP
\fBPCSOUND_DRIVER\fR
When running in PC speaker sound effect mode, this environment variable
specifies a PC speaker driver to use for sound effect playback.  Valid
options are "Linux" for the Linux console mode driver, "BSD" for the
NetBSD/OpenBSD PC speaker driver, and "SDL" for SDL-based emulated PC speaker
playback (using the digital output).
.TP
\fBOPL_DRIVER\fR
When using OPL MIDI playback, this environment variable specifies an
OPL backend driver to use.  Valid options are "SDL" for an SDL-based
software emulated OPL chip, "Linux" for the Linux hardware OPL driver,
and "OpenBSD" for the OpenBSD/NetBSD hardware OPL driver.

Generally speaking, a real hardware OPL chip sounds better than software
emulation; however, modern machines do not often include one. If
present, it may still require extra work to set up and elevated
security privileges to access.
