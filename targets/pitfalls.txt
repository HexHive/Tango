# Pitfalls when setting up protocol servers

## llhttp/expat/yajl

- Dilemma: Tango hooks the first read(fd=0) syscall and redirect the control
  flow to forkserver where all reads are disabled due to unknown reason. I have
  to disable such a read here. Only these three targets are not compatible with
  ENABLE_SHARED_PAGE_CHECK.

## RTSP (live555)

- Live555 is designed to handle delayed events with timers, which introduces
  non-determinism. Tango uses libfaketime with  FAKETIME="+0 i0" and
  FAKETIME_NO_CACHE="1" to address this.
- Live555 suffers from the overhead of recovering opened files with Tango's
  forkserver enabled.

## SIP (kamailio)

- Kamailio suffers from the overhead of remapping feature_map/pc_map as kamailio
  dynamically loads shared objects with dlopen().
- Kamailio suffers from the overhead of recovering MAP_SHARED pages with Tango's
  forkserver enabled (ENABLE_SHARED_PAGE_CHECK=1).

## DAAP (daap-forked)

- Daap-forked uses conftest that maybe has issues when sanitizer is enabled,
  ASLR is disabled, and -fPIE/-pie is enabled in LDFLAGS.
- Daap-forked blocks SIGTERM for all threads except the main one.
- Daap-forked has multiple threads (race-conditions).
- Daap-forked involves a readv that is not support by Tango at first place.
- Daap-forked requires a flexible Snapshot comparison.

## FTP (bftpd, lightftp, proftpd, and pureftpd)

- Proftpd/Pureftpd uses conftest that maybe has issues when sanitizer is enabled,
  ASLR is disabled, and -fPIE/-pie is enabled in LDFLAGS.
- Proftpd will open and append data into scoreboard_file. With forkserver, Tango
  should handle this. However, with forkserver, this file is reopened in the
  child process, thus the parent loses the control of the file. Tango patches
  proftpd to truncate this file when it is opened. See scoreboard_file.patch.
- Lightftp creates a few threads, so Tango's ptrace is adjusts.
- Pureftpd is not compatible with ASAN
- Proftpd needs cap_sys_ptrace.
- Proftpd has nondetermism due to timers.
